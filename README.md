# RustExercises
This year I decided to learn Rust, so I started searching for some online courses and I ended up watching a Crash Course, 
which helped me understand some of the fundamentals.

After that I decided I wanted to be able to make any simple program I thought in Rust, again my friend told me about Advent of Code and so I said "Ok, I will try to
solve these problems with Rust as an exercise", then I realized I still need a little bit more practice.

So then I decided to create this repository, where I will upload any exercise/program/anything I make to practice and understand more about Rust.
